The word polymorphism means *\"many forms,\"* and in programming, it refers to the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same parent class. More specifically, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own unique way.  \n",
        "This is important because it adds **flexibility** and **reusability** to a program. For example, you might have a parent class called `Animal` with a method called `sound()`, and multiple child classes like `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Cow`, each overriding the `sound()` method. Even though the method name is the same, each class will respond differently when the method is called. This allows a programmer to write code that works with objects of different types but uses the same interface, making the program easier to extend and manage.  \n",

The actual implementation of these methods is done in the subclasses that inherit from the abstract class.  \n",
        "In Python, abstract classes are defined using the `abc` module, which stands for Abstract Base Classes. To declare a class as abstract, it must inherit from `ABC` (a base class from the `abc` module). Methods inside it that are meant to be abstract are marked with the `@abstractmethod` decorator.

        "- In Python, the __del__ method is a special method, also known as a destructor, which is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed or deleted from memory. The main purpose of this method is to perform clean-up actions such as releasing external resources, closing open files, disconnecting from networks, or freeing up memory occupied by the object before the program completely removes the object.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  The __del__ method is typically used in situations where an object holds resources other than memory — like file handles or network connections — which need to be properly closed or released once the object is no longer needed. By defining a __del__ method inside a class, a programmer can ensure that these tasks are automatically handled when the object is deleted.\n",

While they both offer ways to define methods that are logically connected to the class, they serve different purposes and behave differently.\n",

This means it cannot access or modify class-level or instance-level attributes and methods. Static methods behave like normal functions but are placed within the class’s namespace for organizational purposes. They are typically used for utility functions or operations related to the class but independent of class and instance attributes.\n",

In Python, polymorphism works very smoothly with the concept of inheritance, where a child class inherits properties and methods from a parent class.\n",

        "  When a parent class defines a method, and multiple child classes inherit from it while providing their own specific implementations of the same method, this is called method overriding. During program execution, when the method is called through an object, Python decides which version of the method to invoke based on the object's class. This behavior is known as runtime polymorphism, and it allows writing flexible, reusable, and extendable code.\n",

This is possible when each method returns the object itself (usually by returning self at the end of the method). By doing this, the next method call can immediately follow the previous one, creating a continuous chain of method calls.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Method chaining improves the readability and conciseness of the code. It’s especially useful when performing a sequence of related operations on an object, where writing each method call separately on different lines might make the code longer and harder to follow. With method chaining, these operations can be grouped logically into a single line, making the code cleaner and easier to understand.\n",

        "- In Python, the __call__ method is a special or magic method that allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. This means that if a class defines the __call__ method, then its objects can be called using parentheses (), just like regular functions. When the object is called, Python automatically executes the __call__ method defined within the class.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  The main purpose of the __call__ method is to make instances of a class behave like functions. This is particularly useful in scenarios like function wrappers, decorators, or when designing classes where objects should perform an action when called directly. It helps in writing more dynamic, flexible, and clean code structures.\n",

        "    In this example, even though greeting is an object of the Greet class, it behaves like a function because the class has a __call__ method. When we use greeting(\"Deepesh\"), it triggers the __call__ method.\n",

        "  Benefits of __call__:  \n",
        "  - Makes objects callable like functions.\n",
        "  - Useful in decorators, event handlers, or factory pattern designs.\n",
